# WARNING

1. We won't make a volume of this file in order to avoid to alter the nginx when we are pulling.
That means that after each pull you will have to update the nginx by hand.

2. If you want to create a new conf file for nginx which is for another app on your server. Create it here but it must end by ".ext.conf" in order to avoid to push it in the git repo.
